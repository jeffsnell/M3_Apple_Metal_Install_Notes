# Installing TensorFlow and Apple Metal GPU Support on Apple M3

The Apple M3 GPU delivers very good performance (not demonstrated here) when used to implement ML models using TensorFlow / TensorFlow-Hub / Keras.

This notebook documents one way that I have found to install the necessary software. This uses conda and assumes that you have that installed before you start. This uses Jupyter Lab, but it is not required to use Apple Metal.

There are three steps to this process:

1. Create and activate an environment
2. Install the packages
3. Install & start Jupyter Lab
4. Check the software
